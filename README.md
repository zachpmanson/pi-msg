# pi-msg

Drive the [Pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent **entirely from an XMPP chat client** —
1:1 or in a group chat (MUC).

`pi-msg` launches `pi --mode rpc`, then bridges Pi's JSONL event stream to XMPP
(via [mellium.im/xmpp](https://mellium.im/xmpp)): the assistant's replies are relayed
to you as chat messages, and your chat messages drive the agent — plain prompts **and**
slash commands, exactly as if you'd typed them into Pi locally.

Because it runs Pi in RPC mode, commands like `/new` work over chat (an earlier
in-process-extension version couldn't do this — `sendUserMessage` can't invoke Pi's
command layer).

## How it works

```
XMPP client (you)                 pi-msg                      pi --mode rpc
  │  "fix the build"  ───────────▶ prompt ──────────────────▶ agent runs
  │  ◀─────────────── assistant text ◀── message_end event ──┘
  │  "/new"           ───────────▶ {type:"new_session"} ─────▶ fresh session
```

- Each finished **assistant message** → sent to you as chat.
- Agent state shows on three independent signals (1:1): a **typing indicator** while a
  reply is actually being written, presence **`<show>`** (`dnd` while busy, available
  when idle), and a presence **status** label of the current activity (`thinking…`,
  `running: <cmd>`, `replying…`, `retrying…`, `listening`). When a run settles with
  **no** text you get a `✅ done (no reply) — your turn` nudge.
- Messages you send are acknowledged with **read receipts** — XEP-0184 delivery
  receipts and XEP-0333 chat markers (`displayed`) — when the agent takes them in, if
  your client requests them.
- Your chat messages → routed to Pi:

| You send | Becomes |
| --- | --- |
| plain text | a prompt to the agent |
| `/skill:name …`, `/template …`, any extension command | a prompt (Pi expands/runs it) |
| `/new` | `new_session` (fresh session; connection stays up) |
| `/compact [instructions]` | `compact` |
| `/model <provider/id>` or `/model <search>` | `set_model` |
| `/think <off\|low\|medium\|high\|…>` | `set_thinking_level` |
| `/abort` (or `/stop`) | `abort` |
| `/dump` | send the raw session JSONL to the owner (no LLM turn) |
| `/quit` (or `/exit`) | shut down the bridge and Pi |

## Configuration

Create `~/.config/pi-msg/config.json` (override the path with `PI_MSG_CONFIG`), then
`chmod 600` it:

```json
{
  "accounts": {
    "default": {
      "jid": "pi@chat.example.com",
      "password": "super-secret",
      "owner": "you@chat.example.com",
      "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-latest",
      "workdir": "/path/to/your/project"
    }
  }
}
```

Per-account fields:

| field | required | default | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `jid` | yes | — | bare JID of the bot account |
| `password` | yes | — | bot account password |
| `owner` | yes | — | the human this account relays to; the **canonical** (trusted) driver |
| `service` | no | `<jid-domain>:5222` | `host:port` (a leading `xmpp://` is tolerated) |
| `resource` | no | `pi-msg` | XMPP resource (client-session label) |
| `model` | no | Pi's default | model pattern passed to `pi --model` |
| `workdir` | no | current dir | working directory for the agent (also where Pi discovers `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) |
| `room` | no | — | a bare MUC JID (or an **array** of them) to also join for **group chat** (see below) |
| `nick` | no | JID localpart | occupant nickname used in the room(s) |
| `roomTrigger` | no | `nick` | address prefix that makes a room message a prompt (e.g. `pi` → `pi: …`) |

Multiple accounts: add more keys under `accounts`; `default` is used unless you set
`PI_MSG_ACCOUNT=<name>`. In 1:1 mode only the `owner` JID may drive the agent.

## Group chat (MUC)

Set `room` on an account (a single MUC JID, or an array of them) and pi-msg
**also** joins each. **The owner's 1:1 stays the primary channel** — joining a
room is purely additive and doesn't change 1:1 behaviour (typing indicator,
lifecycle notices, and unsolicited output all still go to the owner). Each reply
goes back to whichever channel the message arrived on, including the specific
room when several are joined. Room messages are handled on **two independent
axes**:

- **Trigger** — does the message start/steer a turn?
  - the **owner** → always
  - anyone else who **addresses the bot by name** (`pi: …` / `pi, …`) → always
  - all other chatter → never (it's buffered as ambient context)
- **Authority** — is the content trusted?
  - the **owner** → canonical (authoritative)
  - everyone else, even when addressing the bot → untrusted *commentary*; the agent is
    told to use its judgment and is under no obligation to act on it

Untriggered messages are buffered and, on the next turn, prepended to the prompt as a
clearly-labeled *"room commentary — non-canonical"* block, then the buffer clears.

**Reply routing (explicit `from:`/`to:`).** When an account has room access, routing is
fully explicit — no guessing. Each prompt the agent receives leads with a header naming
the message's origin:

```
from: <channel jid>     # the room (group msg) or the owner (DM) — reply here to answer in place
sender: <person jid>    # room messages only, when the real JID is known — reply here to DM them
<message body>
```

And **every** agent reply must begin with a `to: <jid>` line naming its destination:

- `to: <room jid>` → the group chat (groupchat)
- `to: <owner or occupant jid>` → that person, 1:1

Destinations are **allowlisted**: the owner, joined room(s), and real JIDs currently seen
in a room. A reply whose `to:` is missing or points anywhere else is sent to the owner, so
nothing is silently lost — the agent can't message arbitrary users. In a pure 1:1 account
(no room) there are no prefixes; replies just go to the owner.

**The room must be non-anonymous** (ejabberd: *"Present real Jabber IDs to → anyone"*,
optionally *members-only*). The owner is recognized by real JID; in a semi-anonymous
room real JIDs are hidden, so the owner can't be distinguished and every message falls
through to the untrusted/ambient tiers.

## Run

```bash
go build -o pi-msg . && ./pi-msg     # from the repo
```

### Nix

```bash
nix run   github:zachpmanson/pi-msg    # run the bridge
nix build github:zachpmanson/pi-msg    # build the package (bin: pi-msg)
```

Dev shell (Go + gopls) via `nix develop`, or automatically with
[direnv](https://direnv.net/) — the repo ships a `.envrc` (`use flake`); run
`direnv allow` once.

Set `PI_MSG_DEBUG=1` to print connection/status/stderr diagnostics. On startup you
should see `🟢 pi-msg bridge up` in your chat client.

Requirements: Go ≥ 1.26 (to build), and a `pi` on `PATH` that's logged into a provider
(`pi` → `/login`).

## Notes

- Pi runs tools autonomously (no built-in approval prompts). If some other extension
  raises a dialog (`select`/`confirm`/`input`/`editor`), pi-msg auto-dismisses it
  (nobody's at the TUI) and tells you over chat — so approval-gated tools are declined
  over the bridge.
- Auth uses SASL SCRAM-SHA-256 (mellium negotiates it cleanly against ejabberd);
  STARTTLS is required first.
